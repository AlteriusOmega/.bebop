# bebop
This project aims to create a web application which will take in a chord or chords (aimed towards jazz chords) and output various
"bebop style" melodies. These will be created by interpreting the type of chord and determining the proper scale to use, then adding notes
that approach chord tone notes to create a flowing bebop lick with waves of tension and release.
Currently the project can output note names for 2 types of bebop melodies: chromatic approach from below and diatonic (scalar) approach 
from above.

In the future, the scope of the project will include outputting the notes as audible sound using tone.js, and readable sheet music
using LilyPond.
